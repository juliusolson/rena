Rena is an app that is intended to help problem gamblers decrease or quit gambling. The app is based on science and developed together with problem gamblers.

**Features**

* Översikt (overview) - What are you actually spending on gambling? A weekly overview of your gambling expenses in relation to other expenses.
* Sparmål (saving goals) - Concretize your goals by setting up saving goals! Also helps you set up a weekly saving plan and gambling budget.
* Socialt (Social) - You are not alone! See the pins you have been awarded with, who is number one in the top list, and what other people are experiencing on their journey to decrease/quit gambling.
* Stöd (support) - Sometimes you need a little extra support. Remind yourself of why you want to decrease/quit gambling in the first place and distract yourself from acute gambling urges with immersive challenges!
